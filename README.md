## 👻 Ghost Radio Demo

For Halloween, I built a DIY "ghost communicator" using a Raspberry Pi and FM transmitter.  
Instead of relying on ghost‑hunting gadgets, I created my own contraption that broadcasts spooky audio over FM radio frequencies — making it sound like a ghost is talking through your FM radio... or your car or something... For full transparency, I had used Google Ai Studios to help me develop the code - to get it working... 

This project combines:

    🎃 Raspberry Pi Model B 1 +  Si4713 FM transmitter

    📻 Flask web server for uploading and managing ghost sounds

    👻 Pygame audio playback with static background noise

    🛠️ Custom code for file conversion, playback, and frequency scanning
